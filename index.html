            <p>I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at UW-Madison pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Data Science. My ultimate goal in studying CS and working in the tech field has always been to make a positive impact. With the rapid expansion of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), I believe now is a critical and perfect time to make meaningful contributions to the field.</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Building Trustworthy ML Systems by improving model fairness, robustness, and interpretability. Safety is important for deployment!</li>
                    <li>LLMs for scientific research: What can Transformers learn during In Context Learning?</li>
                    <li>Researching more efficient alternatives to Transformer architectures.</li>
